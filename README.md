Four in a row is programmed in Python 3.5.3 using the standard library.

four_in_a_row.py is the main program that runs the game with a
graphical user interface made with Tk.

four_in_a_row_command_line.py is a command line version of the program.

Both uses the program engine.py that computes the moves.

The directory testing_and_research is not needed for playing the game, but
includes programs that have been used for developing the game.
